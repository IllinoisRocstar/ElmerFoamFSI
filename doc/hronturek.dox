@section hronturekdescription Problem Description

A series of benchmark fluid-solid interaction problems can be described by the Hron-Turek Problem.
Here there is a laminar incompressible flow (\f$ F \f$) is entering a 2D channel from its left side \n with a parabolic
(fully-developed) velocity profile. A cylinder with a cantilever beam attached to it (\f$ S \f$) is submerged into the fluid 
in the middle fo the channel clost to its entry. \n A traction load applied by fluid motion develops on the faces of the cylinder 
and cantilever beam and causes the beam to deform. \n The configuration of the problem is such that a self-induced oscillation 
will develop in the fluid and the beam. \n Figure 1 shows the geometry below.

![Figure 1. Domain and boundary conditions for the Hron-Turek verification problem](htfsigeo.png)

Let's denote the deformation at the end-point of the beam by (\f$ \delta_y \f$). The objective here is to study how accurately
the variation of this deformation can be captured. \n The velocity profile is ramped from zero to its final profile (\f$ \bar{U}=2 m/s \f$) in
the transition period of \f$ T_{trans} = 0.1s \f$. Which is then kept constant for the rest of the simulation. \n
The table below summarizes the properties of the solid and fluid used in the simulation.

@section inputs ElmerFoamFSI Inputs
 
In ElmerFoamFSI, OpenFOAM (finite-volume solver) is used as the fluid solver and Elmer (finite-element solver) is used as the structural solver. \n
Here both weak and strong coupling appraches can be used to solve FSI problems. The simple dynamic problem currently utilizes a weak-coupling algorithm. \n
Please take a look at \ref examples for further information regarding the structure of each input file.

@subsection elmerinput Elmer Input

Elmer can be used to find deformation of a solid object (\f$ U \f$) subjected to different types of loads. \n
To capture large deformations of the solid ElmerFoamFSI uses the non-linear solver. Here the description of the problem starts with the input files. \n \n
 
The <b> .GRD </b> file provides the description of the geometry of the problem \n
The <b> .SIF </b> file provides rest of the definitions, including material properties and boundary conditions \n
- It's important to note that in the SIF file: 1, 2, 3 correspond to X, Y, Z direction in a cartesian grid \n
- The <b> .SIF </b> file is read by the \b ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO upon execution \n

@subsection foaminput OpenFOAM Input
 
Here, OpenFOAM acts as the fluid solver to solve for the fluid pressure (\f$ p \f$) and velocity (\f$ U \f$) found in <b> ./fluid/0/ </b>. \n
To capture the deformations of the solid/fluid interface, OpenFOAM has to perform mesh update and re-meshing procedures to maintain the quality
of the grid. \n OpenFOAM requires both the definition of the solid and the fluid sections of the grid (in ElmerFoamFSI, the solid definition is replaced
by Elmer. \n To setup a fluid problem, a strict folder/file hierarchy must be followed. \n \n

There should be at-least three major sub-folders in the main fluid problem (\b ./fluid/ ): \n
These sub-folders are:
- <b> ./fluid/0/ </b> containing the initial and boundary conditions for the problem. We specify the initial and boundary conditions for the pressures,
velocities and grid deformation in three separate files with proper names.
- <b> ./fluid/system/ </b> containing a series of input files to specify which solvers and strategies should be used. 
- <b> ./fluid/constant/ </b> containing the description of the grid and material properities. Here the folder contains info about the problem geometry.
  - Within this folder is <b> blockMeshDict </b> (may not necessarily be named blockMeshDict depending on the example) which reads the geometric data.

@section runninghtfsi Running The Hron-Turek Problem

The requirements listed in this dynamic example are an extension of the instructions given in \ref main and should be completed before
starting the following steps. \n
In order to execute the simple dynamic verification problem with ElmerFoamFSI, Elmer input and ElmerFoamFSI input file should be copied to the ./fluid. folder of the OpenFOAM input hierachy. Following directions are steps to take to run a problem :
- Obtain input_data files of SimpleDynamic problem.
- Create a folder and copy Allclean, Allrun (scripts), /fluid/ and /solid/ folders into this folder, make sure to copy all sub-folders as well.
> Make sure your folder has following files: Allclean, Allrun, AllrunPar, makeLinks, makeSerialLinks, removeSerialLinks (scripts so far), fluid(folder), solid(folder)
- Copy elmer SIF, GRD and ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO files to /fluid/.
- Run <b> ./Allclean </b>  and <b> ./Allrun </b>  to clean-up and prepare input files for the OpenFOAM.
- Go to ./fluid/ and type <b> ElmerGrid 1 2 name </b> where "name" should be replaced with the name of the GRD file for Elmer.
- Run ElmerFoamFSI the FSI simulation by "elmerformfsi name" where name should be re-placed with the name of ElmerFoamFSI input file.
> <b> ./path/to/elmerfoamfsi/elmerfoamfsi test.config </b> (typically found in the top level /build/bin folder)

As a result of simulation, you will obtain VTK,VTU outputs along with many log files. Output files can be further post processed by using tools such as Paraview.

@section htfsi_results Expected Results

This problem does not have an exact solution. A reference solution provided by Turek and Hron (2006) will be used instead for comparison purposes. \n
Here the problem is solved with ElmerFoamFSI which utilizes OpenFOAM for the fluid and Elmer for the solid calculations. The tractions, displacement and
velocities are transmitted between the solver through IMPACT. \n The solid solver used in Elmer is a non-linear elastic solver to account for the large
deformation, which is a reasonable assumption for the order of strains observed in this problem. The solid mesh for Elmer is generated by ElmerGrid.
The simulation results below shows the contour plot for fluid velocity, pressure and the displacement history for the tip of the beam as obtained by ElmerFoamFSI.

@subsection htfsi_discussion Results and Discussion

Since there is no exact solution available in this case. The ElmerFoamFSI solution is compared against what is reported in Turek and Hron (2006). \n The amplitude
and period for the beam deflection \f$ \delta_y \f$ are about <i>0.035m</i> and <i>0.18s</i>, respectively. \n ElmerFoamFSI predictions for these quantities are approximately
<i>0.038m</i> and <i>0.18s</i> that matches with the reference. \n The error for both ElmerFoamFSI can be acceptable because of:
- Numerical errors associated to the discretization
- The simple non-iterative nature of the solution scheme
